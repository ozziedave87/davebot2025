Description:
This script listens for a button press on GPIO 26 to initiate a soft shutdown 
of the Raspberry Pi. A momentary open button must be held for 5 seconds to trigger shutdown.

## How to Run on Raspberry Pi Startup:
### Option 1: Using systemd (Recommended)
1. Create a systemd service file:
   sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/shutdown-button.service
2. Add the following content:
   [Unit]
   Description=Davebot Shutdown Button Service
   After=multi-user.target

   [Service]
   Type=simple
   ExecStart=/usr/bin/python3 /path/to/shutdown.py
   Restart=always
   User=pi

   [Install]
   WantedBy=multi-user.target
3. Save and exit.
4. Reload systemd:  
   sudo systemctl daemon-reload
5. Enable the service to run on boot:  
   sudo systemctl enable shutdown-button
6. Start the service manually for testing (optional):  
   sudo systemctl start shutdown-button
7. Check service status:  
   sudo systemctl status shutdown-button

To stop the service: sudo systemctl stop shutdown-button

### Option 2: Using crontab (@reboot)
1. Open crontab:  
   crontab -e
2. Add the following line at the bottom:  
   @reboot /usr/bin/python3 /path/to/shutdown.py &
3. Save and exit.
4. Reboot to test:  
   sudo reboot
